Telecommunication system to analyze and monitor the performance of LTE networks using AI
The telecommunications industry has grown in importance for both humans and the global economy. As a result, it has continued to grow and make strenuous efforts to advance in that field. As a result, operators' top priority these days is to provide high Quality of Service (QoS) to their customers while also considering their own interests. Drive testing collects real-time data of the RF environment when placed under a certain set of environmental and network conditions. This aims to track network performance from the perspective of users. As a result, network simulation techniques will be used to optimize network performance by creating machine learning models to evaluate network performance. In this project, an LTE network performance analysis tool will be discussed. This tool will collect wireless data, analyze it, classify it into cell state classes then suggest solutions, and predict the future throughput of each cell.

### Methodology

The project consists of these steps: 

1- Data Collection; Collect samples of wireless parameters using Ascom TEMS software. 
2- Data Preprocessing; Exporting log files into excel sheets and then preprocessing these sheets using pandas library. 
3- Data Understanding/Visualization: Visualize the collected data to understand the distribution and relations between each parameter.
4- Machine Learning Models: Train different machine learning estimators to predict the actual data bitrate and classify network problems. 
5- Evaluate the performance of the ML models and choose the best estimator to work with.

### Tools
Software Tools: TEMS Investigation V16 - TEMS Discovery V11 - Google Colaboratory (Python) - Microsoft Excel 
Hardware Tools: Samsung Galaxy S5 - SIM Card - Global Positioning System - Inverter - Dongle
