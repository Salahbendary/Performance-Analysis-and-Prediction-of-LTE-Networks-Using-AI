# Performance Analysis and Prediction of LTE Networks Using AI
 Telecommunication system to analyze and monitor the performance of LTE networks using AI

The project consists of these steps: 

1- Data Collection; Collect samples of wireless parameters using Ascom TEMS software. 
2- Data Preprocessing; Exporting log files into excel sheets and then preprocessing these sheets using pandas library. 
3- Data Understanding/Visualization: Visualize the collected data to understand the distribution and relations between each parameter.
4- Machine Learning Models: Train different machine learning estimators to predict the actual data bitrate and classify network problems. 
5- Evaluate the performance of the ML models and choose the best estimator to work with.

Software Tools: TEMS Investigation V16 - TEMS Discovery V11 - Google Colaboratory (Python) - Microsoft Excel 
Hardware Tools: Samsung Galaxy S5 - SIM Card - Global Positioning System - Inverter - Dongle
