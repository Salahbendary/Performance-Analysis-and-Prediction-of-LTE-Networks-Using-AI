Welcome to the repository for my graduation project that focuses on the Performance Analysis and Prediction of LTE Networks using Artificial Intelligence! 🚀 This project earned an excellent grade "A" and showcases my proficiency in telecommunication systems and machine learning applications. 📡🤖

## Project Overview
In this project, I embarked on a journey to optimize and enhance the efficiency of LTE networks through cutting-edge technologies and data-driven approaches. Here's a breakdown of the key steps I undertook:

1. **Cell State Classification**: I delved into the heart of LTE networks by utilizing Ascom TEMS software to gather wireless parameter samples. This ensured a robust and reliable dataset for my analysis. [Check it out here](https://github.com/Salahbendary/Performance-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-LTE-Networks-Using-AI/tree/main/Cell%20State%20Classification) 📊

2. **Data Analysis**: Armed with data, I employed the pandas library to preprocess log files into Excel sheets, enhancing data quality for subsequent stages. [Take a closer look](https://github.com/Salahbendary/Performance-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-LTE-Networks-Using-AI/tree/main/Data%20Analysis) at how I turned raw data into valuable insights! 🔍📈

3. **Throughput Prediction**: Leveraging the power of machine learning, I trained and evaluated various estimators to predict actual data bitrate and identify network problems.
